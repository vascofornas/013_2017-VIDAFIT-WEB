          <p>Iwoo Limited of 5 Elstree Gate, Elstree Way, Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom, WD6 1JD with company number 09042155, trading as Tru.Be ("<strong>Tru.Be</strong>" or "<strong>we</strong>" or "<strong>us</strong>”) cares about and is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. Tru.Be is registered as a data controller for the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998. Our registration number on the register of data controllers maintained by the Information Commissioner is <strong>ZA089757</strong>.</p>

	<p>This Privacy and Cookies Policy, together with the <a href="../terms/index.html">Terms</a>, applies to your use of the App, the Website (which together with the App we refer to in this policy as the “<strong>Sites</strong>”) and the Tru.Be Services we provide you via the Sites.</p>

	<p>Except where otherwise expressly stated or where it is clear from the context that this Privacy and Cookies Policy is only applicable to certain Users of the Sites and Tru.Be Services, this Privacy and Cookies Policy applies to all Users of the Sites and Tru.Be Services, including Service Providers.</p>

	<p>Capitalised words and phrases which are used in this Privacy and Cookies Policy have the meanings given to them in the Terms, unless otherwise defined in this Privacy and Cookies Policy.</p>

	<p>This Privacy and Cookies Policy sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.</p>
	
	<p>Please note that this Privacy and Cookies Policy does not apply:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>to third party websites that the Sites link to or from or any third party services that may be accessible through them (for example, websites which advertise the Sites or the Tru.Be Services). Tru.Be does not accept any responsibility for such websites’ privacy policies or for any personal data that may be collected through such websites or services. Please check the privacy policies of third party websites before you submit any personal data to such websites; or</li>
		<li>in respect of information that you choose to provide directly to a Service Provider, such as information in relation to your health and fitness that you provide during a Booking. Tru.Be does not accept any responsibility for any Service Provider’s use of such information.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2><a name="1"></a>1. A Summary of How We Collect and Use Your Information</h2>
	<p>1.1. We collect various information about you for various purposes, including to allow you to register for the App and use the Sites and to provide you with the Tru.Be Services. Click <a href="#2">here</a> to learn more about the information we collect about you and <a href="#5">here</a> to learn more about how we use such information.</p>
	<p>1.2. We use cookies and other technologies to identify you when you use the App and track your use of the Sites. Click <a href="#4">here</a> to learn more.</p>
	<p>1.3. We disclose information publicly when Users (excluding Users who are Service Providers) make Submissions. We also disclose information to Service Providers about each User who has made a Booking, and vice versa, so that the Service Providers can provide the Service Provider Services, and in connection with ratings, comments, scores, feedback and complaints. We may also disclose information about you in other circumstances (for example, to third parties we engage to process data on our behalf (including our payment processing partner(s)) and when required to do so by law). Click <a href="#6">here</a> to learn more.</p>
	<p>1.4. The Sites may be hosted on web servers outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and the third parties to whom we transfer information about you may be based outside of the EEA. By using the Sites you agree to the transfer of information about you to jurisdictions outside of the EEA which may not provide the same level of data protection as your home country.  Click <a href="#7">here</a> to learn more.</p>
    
    <h2><a name="2"></a>2. Information we collect about you</h2>
	<p>By using the Sites you are consenting to our collection of the following types of information about you, which we will use in accordance with this Privacy and Cookies Policy:</p>

	<h3>2.1. Information you provide or make available to us</h3>
	<p>We collect personal information about you when you register for the App and use the Sites, including (as applicable) when you complete or update your profile on the App; communicate with us for any reason; make, accept or cancel Bookings; leave ratings, comments, feedback and/or scores for a Service Provider or User; and make Submissions. Such information may include your:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>name</li>
		<li>gender</li>
		<li>contact details (including your address, email address and/or telephone number)</li>
		<li>age, birthday and/or date of birth</li>
		<li>Login (which may include the credentials you use for a third party service such as Facebook if you choose to register for the App using such credentials)</li>
		<li>any information which is publicly available as part of your Facebook profile, if you choose to register for the App using your Facebook credentials</li>
		<li>any information you include in your profile on the App and/or provide to us in connection with a Booking, including any sensitive personal data you choose to provide (for example, relevant information about your health and fitness) and any photograph you choose to upload from your computer, mobile device, technology or other device (“<strong>Device</strong>”).</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>2.2. Information you provide or make available to us</h3>
	<p>We may ask each Service Provider to provide us with feedback and an overall score in relation to a User’s condition, strength, endurance and performance during the Booking. Such information may include sensitive personal data (for example, about health and fitness) about the User.</p>
	<p>If you are a Service Provider, then following each Booking we ask the relevant User to provide a rating and comments about you and the Service Provider Services you provided.</p>

	<h3>2.3. Location Data</h3>
	<p>We may collect data about your location from your Device using GPS technology (“<strong>Location Data</strong>”). Location Data helps the App identify your location in order to help you make a Booking, or if you are a Service Provider to help us match you to Bookings based on your location. We will ask for your consent prior to collecting Location Data from you. You may withdraw such consent at any time by disabling the App’s access to your location using the settings within your Device or the App. If you do not give consent or withdraw it, you will still be able to use the App by manually identifying your location.</p>

	<h3>2.4. Automatic Information Collection</h3>
	<p>2.4.1. We cookies on the Website to collect and provide us with information about how you access and use the Sites, as further described in section 4.4.</p>
	<p>2.4.2. We may also automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier for the Device you use to access the Sites. A unique identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you access a website, app or its servers, and we can identify your Device by this number ("<strong>Device Identifier</strong>"). Some mobile service providers may also provide us with the physical location of the Device used to access the Sites.</p>

	<h3>2.3. Location Data</h3>
	<p>We work closely with third parties (including, for example, business partners, sub-contractors in technical, payment and delivery services, analytics providers, search information providers and credit reference agencies) and may receive information about you from them.</p>

	<h2><a name="3"></a>3. Payment Data</h2>
	<p>The App will ask you to input payment information (including credit card number, expiry date and CVV number) if you want to make a Booking. This information is collected directly by our third party payment processor, which uses such information to process payment from you. Tru.Be itself does not have access to this information.</p>
	<p>If you have already provided your payment details through the App and attempt to make another Booking, we ask our third party payment processor for details of the payment method(s) you provided previously so that you do not have to enter them again. These details are only partially made available to us (for example, we only see the last four digits of your payment card number), meaning that we never have access to your complete payment details. The App will then display such details to you so that you may use them to make another Booking.</p>
	<p>If you are a Service Provider, we will ask you for your bank account details so that we can make payments to you in respect of Bookings you have attended. We will treat your bank account details in accordance with the terms of this Privacy and Cookies Policy.</p>

	<h2><a name="4"></a>4. Our Use of Cookies and Related Technologies</h2>
	<p>4.1. The Sites use cookies and related technologies such as API keys and tokens to distinguish you from other users of the Sites. This helps us to provide you with a better experience when you use the Sites and to improve the Sites.</p>
	<p>4.2. Cookies and related technologies are small bits of text that are downloaded to your Device when you visit the Sites. Your Device sends these bits of text back to the Sites every time you visit, so it can recognise you and tailor what you see on the screen.</p>
	<p>4.3. We use API tokens and keys in the App to:</p>
	<p>4.3.1. identify and remember your Login so that you do not need to re-enter your Login every time you use the App; and</p>
	<p>4.3.2. analyse and improve your experience of the App, for example to determine what pages, features and links are popular and which ones don't get used so much, which helps us keep the App relevant and up to date.</p>
	<p>4.4. We use Google Analytics cookies in the Website to analyse and improve your experience of the Website and help us keep the Website relevant and up to date, for example to determine what pages, features and links are popular and which ones don't get used so much. The information collected by these cookies may consist of your Internet browser type, operating system, the parts of the Website you viewed, the time you viewed them, your approximate geographic location, and what other webpages you looked at before viewing the Website. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. As such the information collected can’t generally be used to identify you personally, but if we can link such information to you then we treat it in accordance with this Privacy and Cookies Policy. By using the Website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your Device.</p>
	<p>4.5. You can disable the use of cookies and related technologies on your Device by adjusting the settings in your web browser or on your Device. Please note some parts of the Sites may not function if you do so. For more information, please see the <a href="http://ico.org.uk/for_the_public/topic_specific_guides/online/cookies">ICO website</a> or the IAB’s <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/">Your Online Choices</a>.</p>

	<p>5.1.10. to provide you with information about products and services that may be of interest to you. We will only contact you by electronic means (e-mail or SMS) with information about the Sites and Service Provider Services which are similar to those which were the subject of a previous Booking you made or negotiated.

	<h2><a name="6"></a>6. How We Share Your Information</h2>
	<p>We may share your personal information with any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006.</p>
	<p>We may also share your information with third parties in the following circumstances:</p>
	<h3>6.1. When a Booking is made</h3>
	<p>When you make a Booking using the App, we will share information about you with the relevant Service Provider so that the requested Service Provider Service can be provided, including your name, gender, your mobile telephone number, details of the Service Provider Service you have requested, the Appointment Time, the location where the Booking will take place, any information which is available as part of your profile on the App (including any sensitive personal data you have chosen to provide (for example, relevant information about your health and fitness) and your photograph), your age-range, and details of your average score and performance history if you have made previous Bookings.</p>
	<p>If you are a Service Provider, we will share information about you with Users including your full name, gender, any information available on your profile within the App and your photograph. We will also share your mobile telephone number to any User who makes a Booking with you.</p>

	<h3>6.2. When there is a complaint about a Booking</h3>

	<p>If you provide a rating and/or comments about a Service Provider, we may share such rating and/or comments with the Service Provider.</p>

	<p>Third parties (including other Users and Service Providers) may also view and use any Submissions you submit to the Sites.</p>
	<p>We cannot control how third parties may use ratings, comments, feedback, scores and/or Submissions, and this Privacy and Cookies Policy does not apply to such third party use.</p>
	<p>Please therefore ensure that your ratings, comments, Submissions, feedback and scores (as applicable) do not contain any information that you do not want to be seen by the relevant third parties.</p>

	<h3>6.4. Third parties providing services on our behalf</h3>
	<p>We engage a third party to process payments from Users on our behalf. In addition, we may engage third parties to perform other functions on our behalf, such as carrying out credit reference checks, hosting or operating the Sites, sending e-mail communications, and data analysis. We may share your information with such third parties, including any information which is available as part of your profile on the App (including where reasonably necessary to do so, any sensitive personal data you have chosen to provide (for example, relevant information about your health and fitness)). We ask such parties to maintain appropriate security measures to protect such information from unauthorised access or processing.</p>

	<h3>6.5. When you agree to have your information shared</h3>

	<p>7.1. We or any of the parties with whom we share information about you (including any sensitive personal data we hold about you) may transfer information about you to, and store it at, a destination outside the EEA. In particular, such information may be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers.

	<p>9.3. You may ask us to correct or remove information about you that you think is inaccurate by <a href="../contact.html">contacting us</a>.</p>
