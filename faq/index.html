			<h2>Booking Sessions</h2>
			
			<h3>When can I work out?</h3>
			
			<p>Sessions can be booked seven days a week between 6 am and 10 pm. You can book up to one week in advance or with only an hour and 15 minutes' notice. You can even have multiple sessions a day!</p>

			<h3 id="first_booking">How do I make my first booking?</h3>
			
			<p>You'll need to send a session request for a relevant and available trainer to accept. Follow these simple steps:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Login to the app and select the type of session, the time and date.</li>
				<li>Choose to workout in with one of our trainers in an exclusive venue or request a trainer to come to your location.</li>
				<li>A TruBe Trainer has an hour to accept your request or suggest a slightly different time.</li>
				<li>You can then choose your trainer from the list. Your preferred trainers will be at the top of the list. We also encourage you to browse through "Our Trainers" before making a request.</li>
				<li>Trainers can also suggest alternative slots in case your prefered trainer is not available at your exact time.</li>
				<li>Once you are happy with your chosen trainer, tap the time that you would like to workout and you will be taken to the session details page.</li>
				<li>Scan your credit card or enter your payment details manually (you can choose to save these for next time). Payment will be taken only once your session is complete.</li>
				<li>You must enter your mobile number so that our trainer can contact you if he has any problems reaching you.</li>
				<li>Here you can also select the number of people who will be taking part in the workout and you can leave any additional information or directions you think your trainer will find helpful in the notes section.</li>
				<li>Tap 'Send to Trainers'.</li>
				<li>After your session, we'll email a receipt and prompt you to leave a rating for your trainer.</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Can I request a particular trainer?</h3>

			<p>As long as they are available, you can decide who to train with before you book your session. You can favourite any of our trainers to receive your request first. If they are available at your chosen time they will appear at the top of the list.</p>

			<h3>How do I favourite a trainer?</h3>

			<p>You can favourite any of <a href="../trainers/index.html">our trainers</a>, which can then be found in the burger menu.</p>
			
			<h3>What happens if there are no trainers are available?</h3>
			
			<p>We work with a wide network of trainers so it's unlikely your request will ever be declined. However, there may be rare occasions during high-demand periods when we won't be able to find a free trainer. In which case, you won't be charged and you can send a new request for a different time.</p>
			
			<h3>How can I change the time and date of my booking?</h3>
			
			<p>You can modify your booking using the 'Modify Session' button, as long if you're within the cancellation window (12 hours before your session). You can also cancel the booking before this time and request a new session.</p>
			
			<h2>Pricing and payments</h2>
			
			<h3>How much does a session cost?</h3>
			
			<p>There's no contract or monthly fee, prices start from &pound;50 (including VAT) per one-off session. The price remains the same if you decide to invite up to two friends.</p>

			<p>We also offer a monthly subscription plan, called TruPlan. You can choose from:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>4 sessions from &pound;140 per month</li>
				<li>8 sessions from &pound;272 per month</li>
				<li>12 sessions from &pound;396 per month</li>
				<li>16 sessions from &pound;512 per month</li>
			</ul>

			<p>If you choose to workout in one of our exclusive venues there may be an additional cost for your workout. This additional cost will be shown on the venue booking page and is paid to the venue on arrival.</p>

			<h3>What if I run out of sessions on my TruPlan?</h3>

			<p>Don't worry! If you use up all of your sessions, you can purchase top-up sessions at &pound;35 per session. We also have a <a href="#referral_codes">referral scheme</a> in place where you can earn free sessions when you refer a friend to sign-up to a TruPlan.</p>

			<h3>What is Trainer Surcharge?</h3>
		
			<p>Our most experienced or in demand trainers may apply an extra charge to your booking if you choose to book with them.</p>

			<p>If you have purchased a TruPlan and you have chosen a trainer who has applied a surcharge, you will incur an extra cost. This extra cost will be taken from the payment method added to your account, once the session is completed or if the session is cancelled within 12 hours of it starting.</p>

			<h3>How do I pay for a session?</h3>
		
			<p>We'll ask for the details of your preferred credit card after you've sent your first session request. We charge your card after you've completed your session and send a receipt by email.</p>

			<p>If you have subscribed to a TruPlan we will take payment as soon as you subscribe and then monthly, unless cancelled.</p>

			<h3>Are my in-app payments safe?</h3>
			
			<p>You can feel confident making payments with the TruBe app, which meets the relevant payment regulations and security protocols. Please see our <a href="../privacy/index.html">Privacy Policy</a> for full details.</p>
			
<!--
			<h3>Is VAT included?</h3>
			
			<p>VAT is included in all of our pricing.</p>
-->

			<h3>Can I share my plan with my friends and use them individually or as a group?</h3>

			<p>The short answer to this is <strong>yes</strong>, as long as everyone books their sessions with the same account that the plan was purchased on. If these are individual sessions, just specify in the Notes section who the session is for. We've planned a more elegant way of sharing plans as part of our product roadmap, so watch this space!</p>
			
			<h3>Can I gift a session?</h3>
			
			<p>You can <a href="../giftcard/index.html">purchase a gift card</a> for 4 or 8 sessions from our website. The card will be shipped to your UK address. Simply enter this on checkout.</p>

			<h2 id="truplan">TruPlans</h2>

			<h3>What is a TruPlan?</h3>

			<p>A TruPlan is a monthly subscription of 4, 8 and 12 sessions. You will have access to all of our services and all of our highly-rated trainers at a reduced rate. The number of sessions are valid for a month from the date you first purchased your plan.</p>

			<h3>How do I subscribe to a TruPlan?</h3>

			<p>To purchase a TruPlan you must be a registered TruBe user. You can subscribe using the 'Buy TruPlan' button in the main menu.</p>

			<p>You can also buy a TruPlan instead of purchasing a 'pay-as-you-go' session before you book a session.</p>

			<h3>Does my TruPlan renew automatically?</h3>

			<p>Yes, your TruPlan will renew automatically every month unless you cancel your plan. We will take payment on the same date every month where possible.</p>

			<h3>How do I upgrade or downgrade my plan?</h3>

			<p>You can upgrade or downgrade your plan at anytime. Your upgrade or downgrade will only occur after your next billing date. To do this press the my TruPlan button in the burger navigation tab and then the 'Change my plan' button.</p>

			<h3>Can I pause my TruPlan?</h3>

			<p>If you need a break from your sessions, you can pause your TruPlan at no extra cost for as long as you need. We won’t take any more monthly payments until you resume your plan.</p>

			<p>When you're ready to resume your TruPlan, any previously unused sessions will still be available, and your subscription will pick up from where it left off.</p>

			<p>You are still able to complete any sessions already booked.</p>

			<h3>How do I purchase top-up sessions?</h3>

			<p>If you have used up all of your sessions for the month you can purchase top-up sessions at a discounted price. The discount will be applied automatically so just a book a session as normal and we will take payment at the end of your session.</p>

			<h3>How do I cancel my TruPlan?</h3>

			<p>You can cancel your plan at anytime. Once cancelled, your plan will remain active for the current month, giving you a chance to finish off any sessions. On your next billing date, we will no longer take payments. To do this tap the My TruPlan button in the app and then tap on the 'Cancel my plan' button.</p>

			<h3>Can I still use a promo code with my TruPlan?</h3>

			<p>Yes, you can. When you use promo code, the session will not be deducted from your plan. If there is still an outstanding amount to be paid after having applied the promo code, we will charge you at the end of your session.</p>

			<p>If you are using a promo code, the discount will be applied to the total cost of your booking including any additional charges from the trainer. For example, if you have a 50% off promo code and are purchasing a pay-as-you go session for &pound;50, and you picked a trainer who has added a surcharge of &pound;10, the discount will be applied to the full amount of &pound;60, reducing your session to &pound;30.</p>

			<p>If the promo code exceeds the value of the booking the session will be no cost.</p>

			<h2 id="referral_codes">Referral codes</h2>

			<h3>Do you have a referral scheme?</h3>

			<p>Yes, we do! If you have an active TruPlan and refer a friend to TruBe, you will both each get a free session credited to your account when they sign-up for their first TruPlan.</p>

			<h3>How long do the free sessions last for?</h3>

			<p>Free sessions do not expire and are carried over automatically every month. You can then use your free session once all the sessions in your current plan have been used up.</p>

			<h3>How do I refer my friends?</h3>

			<p>You can share your Referral Code using the app by going into the Free Sessions section and tapping on Share My Code. You can then post your Referral Code to your social media channels, email or text message.</p>

			<h3>How do my friends use my Referral Code?</h3>

			<p>Your friends can simply enter your Referral Code on the screen when they are purchasing their TruPlan.</p>

			<h3>I'm getting an error message telling me that a particular Referral Code is incorrect or cannot be used</h3>

			<p>An Referral Code can only be used if the person using it has not had a TruPlan before. Also, please check that the code entered is correct.</p>

			<h2 id="cancellation">Cancellation policy</h2>

			<h3>What is your cancellation policy?</h3>
			
			<p>You'll be charged for your session if cancel within 12 hours of your session starting <i>and</i> you have confirmed your booking with a trainer. For same-day bookings, you'll be given a 5-minute window to make a cancellation free of charge. If your session was part of a TruPlan, this will be deducted from your plan. We'll let you know if any cancellation fees apply before you cancel your session.</p>
			
			<h3>How do I cancel a TruBe session?</h3>
			
			<p>Go to the date of your booking in the app to find the session you want to cancel. Scroll down and tap 'Cancel Session' at the bottom of your screen.</p>
